## Contributing

* If you want to develop and debug this extension from source code, and run 'npm install' under the root dir of this extension,

* npm packages vscode and typescript is needed as an environment

    ```bash
    npm install vscode
    npm install typescript
    ```

* Cannot find module 'vscode'? Please run 'npm run postinstall' under the root dir of this extension,
according to [Cannot find module 'vscode' â€“ where is vscode.d.ts now installed? [#2810](https://github.com/searKing/preview-vscode/issues/2810)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2810#issuecomment-182209917)
  * Error installing vscode.d.ts: Error: connect ETIMEDOUT 51.144.164.215:443
    * npm use npm proxy instead of HTTP_PROXY, so proxy takes no effect if npm_proxy is not set
      * set proxy for npm

        ```bash
        npm config set proxy http://username:password@proxy_server:proxy_port
        npm config set https-proxy http://username:password@proxy_server:proxy_port
        ```

      * another way, run 'npm_config_proxy="http://username:password@proxy_server:proxy_port" npm_config_https_proxy="http://username:password@proxy_server:proxy_port" npm run postinstall' instead(npm_config_https_proxy can be ignored if npm_config_https_proxy is the same as npm_config_proxy).

      * execute `sudo` command with proxy, accroding to [Pro Terminal Commands: How and Why To Edit Sudoers on macOS](https://www.applegazette.com/mac/pro-terminal-commands-how-and-why-to-edit-sudoers-on-macos/)
